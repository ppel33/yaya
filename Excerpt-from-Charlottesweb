Excerpt from Charlotte’s Web by E. B. White
(Chapter 3 – “Escape”)

A few hours later, Fern’s mother stepped out onto the back porch. “Fern!” she called. “Lunch! Hurry up!”
“Coming!” called Fern.

She ran in for lunch, then she ran back out to the yard. The afternoon passed quietly. Wilbur lay in the sun, sleeping. Fern sat nearby, watching. She was thinking about how wonderful it was to have a pig.

That evening, after supper, it was time for Wilbur to go to his new home. Fern took him in her arms and carried him out to the barn. He was small and warm.

The barn was big. It smelled of hay and manure. It had a warm, sweet smell. There were horses in their stalls, and cows chewing their cud. There were sheep in the corner, and chickens in the loft.

Fern’s father opened a small wooden pen. It had clean straw inside. Fern gently placed Wilbur into the pen.

“This will be your new home,” she whispered.

Wilbur looked around. He didn’t like it. It was big. It was dark. It was not the same as being near Fern. He missed her already.

That night, Wilbur could not sleep. He felt lonely. He missed Fern’s voice. He missed the warmth of her hands. He cried, “Oink… oink…”

The other animals heard him.

“What’s all that noise?” grumbled an old sheep.

“Who is that?” asked a goose.

“I’m Wilbur,” said the pig. “I’m lonely.”

“Well, stop crying,” said the sheep. “This is a barn. Everyone sleeps at night.”

Wilbur sniffled. “Okay,” he said softly.

In the morning, the sun came up. The barn was full of light. Wilbur looked around.

A small voice spoke.

“Hello, Wilbur,” it said.

Wilbur looked up. He saw nothing.

“Who said that?” he asked.

“I did,” said the voice. “Up here.”

Wilbur looked up and saw a tiny gray spider. She sat in her web, in the corner of the doorway.

“My name is Charlotte,” said the spider. “I think we can be friends.”

Wilbur smiled. “I would like that,” he said.

And from that moment on, Wilbur was not lonely anymore.
