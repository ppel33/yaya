The Curious Adventure of Callista and the Talking Bird

One morning, Callista woke up and heard a sound. What was it? Was it the wind? Was it the rain? Or was it something else? She opened her window, and what did she see? A bright, colorful bird!

“Hello, child!” said the bird. “Do you like questions?”

Callista’s eyes grew wide. Could a bird really talk? Was she dreaming? Or was this real?

The bird asked, “Do you want to learn words? Do you want to play a game? Do you want to go on an adventure?”

Callista clapped her hands. “Yes! Yes! But where do we go? What do we do?”

The bird smiled. “We go everywhere. We look at everything. We ask questions. Isn’t that the best way to learn?”

They walked into the garden. What is green? What is soft? What grows tall? What makes shade? Callista touched a leaf. “This is green. This is soft. This is a tree. Am I right?”

“Yes, you are right!” said the bird. “But look around. What flies? What crawls? What makes music in the air?”

“Bees fly. Ants crawl. Birds sing. Is that true?” Callista asked.

“Exactly!” said the bird. “Now, let’s go farther. What shines in the sky? What floats in the air? What warms your face?”

Callista looked up. “The sun shines. Clouds float. The sun warms me. Isn’t that wonderful?”

The bird nodded. “Every question gives a word. Every word is a treasure. Don’t you want to collect them all?”

Callista laughed. “Yes! But how many treasures are there? A hundred? A thousand? More?”

“More,” said the bird. “Words are endless. The more you ask, the more you find. Isn’t that the greatest adventure?”

And so Callista kept walking, asking, and learning. Will she ever stop? Do we ever stop? Or do we keep learning all our lives?
